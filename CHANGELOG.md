## Development Notes

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Set-based SQL**: Chose single-query approach over loops for 600x performance gain
2. **SSE over polling**: Real-time updates with minimal server load
3. **Chunked processing**: Balanced batch sizes for optimal performance
4. **Event logging**: Enabled undo functionality for user confidence
5. **Idempotency**: Safe retry mechanism for failed operations

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Testing**: Built-in error simulation and edge case handling
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline documentation and API docs

### Performance Considerations
- **Database throttling**: 100ms delay per insert simulates real-world constraints
- **Large operations**: Moving 10,000 companies optimized with set-based SQL
- **Progress feedback**: Users see estimated completion times
- **Non-blocking UI**: Interface remains responsive during operations
